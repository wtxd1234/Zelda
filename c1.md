# **1. The Economic Problem**

The fundamental problem in economics is **Scarcity**.

* **Unlimited Wants:** Humans have infinite desires (e.g., better phones, bigger houses, more holidays).
* **Limited Resources:** The world has a finite amount of resources to produce these goods.
* **The Result (Scarcity):** We cannot produce everything that everyone wants. Therefore, **choices** must be made about what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom.

## **Needs vs. Wants**
* **Needs:** Goods and services that are essential for survival (e.g., food, water, shelter, warmth).
* **Wants:** Goods and services that are not essential for survival but improve the quality of life (e.g., Netflix, a Ferrari, designer clothes).

> **Exam Tip:** Be careful not to confuse poverty with scarcity. *Everyone* faces scarcity (even Bill Gates), because time and resources are limited for everyone.

# **2. The Factors of Production**
Resources used to produce goods and services are called Factors of Production. Remember the acronym **CELL**.

| Factor | Definition | Examples | Reward |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capital** | Man-made aids to production. | Tractors, factories, computers, hammers. | **Interest** |
| **Enterprise** | The risk-taking and organizing of the other factors. | The entrepreneur (e.g., Elon Musk, a shop owner). | **Profit** |
| **Land** | All natural resources provided by nature. | Oil, gold, fish, forests, water, the physical plot of land. | **Rent** |
| **Labour** | The physical and mental effort used in production. | Teachers, construction workers, doctors. | **Wages** |

> **Critical Note:** In Economics, **Money is NOT Capital.** Capital refers to physical machinery and tools. Money is just a medium of exchange used to buy capital.

# **3. Opportunity Cost**
Because resources are scarce, every time we make a choice, we give up something else.

* **Definition:** The value of the **next best alternative** foregone (given up) when a choice is made.

**Examples:**
1.  **Consumer:** You have £10. You can buy a book or a pizza. You buy the pizza. The *opportunity cost* is the book.
2.  **Government:** The government has £1 billion. They can build a hospital or a new motorway. They build the hospital. The *opportunity cost* is the motorway.

# **4. The Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)**
The PPF (also called PPC - Production Possibility Curve) is a graph that shows the concepts of **Scarcity**, **Efficiency**, and **Opportunity Cost**.

* **Definition:** A curve showing the maximum combination of two goods that can be produced by an economy when all resources are fully and efficiently employed.

## **Interpreting the Graph**
1.  **Points ON the curve (A, B):**
    * The economy is **efficient**.
    * All resources are fully utilized.
    * To produce more of Good X, you *must* produce less of Good Y (Opportunity Cost).
2.  **Points INSIDE the curve (C):**
    * The economy is **inefficient**.
    * There is unemployment of resources (e.g., empty factories, unemployed workers).
    * Production can increase without an opportunity cost.
3.  **Points OUTSIDE the curve (D):**
    * Currently **unobtainable**.
    * There are not enough resources to produce at this level yet.

## **Shifts in the PPF**
The PPF line itself can move.
* **Outward Shift (Right):** Represents **Economic Growth**. Caused by:
    * New technology (innovation).
    * Discovery of new resources (e.g., new oil fields).
    * Increase in the quality or quantity of labour (better education/training).
* **Inward Shift (Left):** Represents **Negative Economic Growth**. Caused by:
    * Natural disasters destroying infrastructure.
    * War.
    * Depletion of resources.

# **5. Types of Goods**

## **Economic Goods**
* Goods that are **scarce**.
* They require resources to produce.
* They have an **opportunity cost**.
* *Examples:* Cars, haircuts, apples.

## **Free Goods**
* Goods that are **unlimited** in supply.
* They require no resources to produce.
* They have **no opportunity cost**.
* *Examples:* Sunlight, air, seawater (in the ocean).

## **Summary Table for Revision**

| Concept | Key Phrase to Memorize |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scarcity** | Unlimited wants vs. Limited resources. |
| **Opportunity Cost** | Next best alternative foregone. |
| **Capital** | Man-made aids (machines). |
| **Enterprise** | Risk-taker. |
| **PPF Shift Right** | Economic Growth. |
