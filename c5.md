# **1. Market Equilibrium**
* **Definition:** The point where the **Quantity Demanded** equals the **Quantity Supplied**.
* At this price, there is no tendency for the price to change.
* It is also called the **Market Clearing Price** because everything produced is sold (the market is "cleared").

## **Key Labels on the Diagram**
* **Pe:** Equilibrium Price.
* **Qe:** Equilibrium Quantity.
* **E:** The Equilibrium point where the lines cross.

# **2. Disequilibrium**
If the price is set *above* or *below* the equilibrium, the market is in **disequilibrium**. Market forces will naturally push the price back towards $P_e$.

## **Scenario A: Excess Supply (Surplus)**
* **Situation:** The price is set **too high** (above equilibrium).
* **Result:** Producers want to sell a lot (high supply), but consumers don't want to buy much (low demand).
* **Math:** Quantity Supplied > Quantity Demanded.
* **The Fix:**
    1.  Firms have unsold stock (surplus).
    2.  They must **lower the price** to sell it.
    3.  As price falls, demand extends and supply contracts until they meet at equilibrium.

## **Scenario B: Excess Demand (Shortage)**
* **Situation:** The price is set **too low** (below equilibrium).
* **Result:** Consumers want to buy a lot (high demand), but producers aren't making enough (low supply).
* **Math:** Quantity Demanded > Quantity Supplied.
* **The Fix:**
    1.  There is a shortage (queues, empty shelves).
    2.  Consumers bid up the price (or firms realize they can charge more).
    3.  As price **rises**, supply extends and demand contracts until they meet at equilibrium.

# **3. Changes in Equilibrium (Shifts)**
In the exam, you will be asked what happens to Price and Quantity if a factor changes (e.g., "Income rises"). You must analyze the shift.

## **Case 1: Increase in Demand (Shift Right)**
* **Cause:** e.g., Consumer income rises for a normal good.
* **Chain of Analysis:**
    1.  Demand curve shifts **Right** ($D_1 \rightarrow D_2$).
    2.  At the old price, there is now a **Shortage** (Excess Demand).
    3.  Price starts to **Rise**.
    4.  **New Equilibrium:** Higher Price ($P_2$) and Higher Quantity ($Q_2$).

## **Case 2: Increase in Supply (Shift Right)**
* **Cause:** e.g., New technology lowers production costs.
* **Chain of Analysis:**
    1.  Supply curve shifts **Right** ($S_1 \rightarrow S_2$).
    2.  At the old price, there is now a **Surplus** (Excess Supply).
    3.  Price starts to **Fall**.
    4.  **New Equilibrium:** Lower Price ($P_2$) and Higher Quantity ($Q_2$).

## **Summary of Shift Effects**

| Shift | Effect on Price | Effect on Quantity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demand Increases (Right)** | Price **Rises** | Quantity **Rises** |
| **Demand Decreases (Left)** | Price **Falls** | Quantity **Falls** |
| **Supply Increases (Right)** | Price **Falls** | Quantity **Rises** |
| **Supply Decreases (Left)** | Price **Rises** | Quantity **Falls** |

> **Exam Tip:** Don't memorize the table above! **Draw a rough sketch** in the margin of your exam paper. Draw the axes, cross the lines, shift one, and see where the new "X" is. It is safer than guessing.
