# **1. What is Market Failure?**
> **Definition:** Market Failure occurs when the price mechanism (supply and demand) fails to allocate resources efficiently, leading to a loss of economic welfare.

In simple terms: The market produces **too much** of bad things (e.g., pollution, cigarettes) or **too little** of good things (e.g., education, street lights).

# **2. Externalities (The Spillover Effect)**
An externality is a cost or benefit caused by a transaction that affects a **third party** (someone not involved in the buying or selling).

## **Key Equations**
To understand this, we must distinguish between "Private" (you) and "Social" (everyone).
1.  **Private Cost:** The cost to the individual producer or consumer (e.g., the factory pays for wood).
2.  **External Cost:** The cost to the third party (e.g., the neighbors breathe polluted air).
3.  **Social Cost:** The total cost to society.
    $$Social Cost = Private Cost + External Cost$$

# **3. Negative Externalities (The "Bad" Spillovers)**
These occur when production or consumption imposes a **cost** on a third party.

* **Examples:**
    * **Pollution:** A factory produces cheap steel (low private cost) but pollutes the air (high external cost).
    * **Passive Smoking:** A smoker enjoys a cigarette, but people around them suffer health issues.
* **The Result:** The market ignores the external cost. Therefore, the price is **too low**, and the quantity produced is **too high**.
    * *The market over-produces and over-consumes goods with negative externalities.*

# **4. Positive Externalities (The "Good" Spillovers)**
These occur when production or consumption creates a **benefit** for a third party.

* **Examples:**
    * **Vaccination:** You get a flu shot (private benefit), but you also stop the virus spreading to others (external benefit).
    * **Education:** You get a degree (private benefit), but society gets a smarter, more productive workforce (external benefit).
* **The Result:** The market ignores the external benefit. Therefore, the price is often **too high** (for the consumer to afford), and quantity is **too low**.
    * *The market under-produces and under-consumes goods with positive externalities.*

# **5. Types of Goods**

This chapter often categorizes goods based on how the market handles them.

## **A. Public Goods**
The free market **cannot** provide these at all because they are:
1.  **Non-Excludable:** You cannot stop someone from using it (e.g., a lighthouse or street light).
2.  **Non-Rival:** One person using it does not reduce the amount available for others.
* **The Problem:** **The Free Rider Problem.** Since you can't force people to pay (non-excludable), no one will pay, so no private firm will produce it.
* **Solution:** The Government must provide it using tax money.

## **B. Merit Goods**
* Goods that are **better** for consumers than they realize.
* They have **Positive Externalities**.
* *Examples:* Education, Healthcare, Gym memberships.
* *Market Status:* Under-consumed.

## **C. Demerit Goods**
* Goods that are **worse** for consumers than they realize.
* They have **Negative Externalities**.
* *Examples:* Alcohol, Tobacco, Junk food.
* *Market Status:* Over-consumed.

# **Summary Table: Chapter 8**

| Term | Definition | Market Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Failure** | Inefficient allocation of resources. | Loss of welfare. |
| **Social Cost** | Private Cost + External Cost. | True cost to society. |
| **Negative Externality** | Harmful effect on a third party. | **Over-production** (Too much). |
| **Positive Externality** | Beneficial effect on a third party. | **Under-production** (Too little). |
| **Public Good** | Non-rival + Non-excludable. | **Missing Market** (Not produced at all). |

> **Exam Tip:** If asked "Why does the government provide education?", do not just say "because it's good." You must use the economic terms: "Because it is a **Merit Good** with **Positive Externalities** that would be **under-consumed** in a free market."
