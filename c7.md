# **1. Definition of PES**
> **Price Elasticity of Supply** measures the **responsiveness** of quantity supplied to a change in price.

* **Elastic Supply:** Producers can **quickly and easily** increase production if price rises.
* **Inelastic Supply:** Producers find it **difficult or slow** to increase production, even if price rises.

# **2. The Formula**
Just like PED, but for Supply.

* **Positive Sign:** Unlike PED, the result for PES is always **positive** (because Price and Supply move in the same direction).

# **3. Interpreting the Value**

| Value | Term | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | **Elastic Supply** | Supply is very responsive. A small price rise leads to a big increase in output. | Plastic toys, digital downloads, fast food. |
| **Less than 1** | **Inelastic Supply** | Supply is unresponsive. A price rise leads to only a small increase in output. | Fresh vegetables (harvest takes time), complex electronics. |
| **Exactly 0** | **Perfectly Inelastic** | Supply cannot change **at all**, no matter the price. | Seats in a stadium (fixed number), fresh fish at the market *today*. |

# **4. The Diagrams**
The slope reveals the flexibility of the firm.

1.  **Elastic Supply:** Flat curve (shallow slope).
    * It starts from the Price axis (Vertical axis).
2.  **Inelastic Supply:** Steep curve.
    * It starts from the Quantity axis (Horizontal axis).
3.  **Perfectly Inelastic Supply:** A **Vertical straight line**.
    * Quantity is fixed at one number (e.g., Q = 100) regardless of price.

# **5. Determinants of PES (What makes Supply Elastic?)**
Remember: **How easy is it to make more?**

### **A. Time Period**
* **Momentary Period (Very Inelastic):** Immediately after a price change, supply is fixed (you can't build a factory in a day).
* **Short Run:** You can hire more workers, but machines are fixed. Supply becomes slightly more elastic.
* **Long Run (Elastic):** You can build new factories and buy new machines. Supply is very elastic.

### **B. Spare Capacity**
* **Unused Machines/Space:** If a factory is only running at 50% capacity, it is **easy** (Elastic) to ramp up production.
* **Full Capacity:** If the factory is running 24/7, it is **hard** (Inelastic) to produce more without building a new factory.

### **C. Level of Stocks (Inventory)**
* **High Stocks:** If you have a warehouse full of finished goods, you can respond instantly to a price rise (Elastic).
* **Perishable Goods:** Goods like fresh fruit cannot be stored, so supply depends on the harvest (Inelastic).

### **D. Production Lag (Agriculture vs. Manufacturing)**
* **Agriculture:** Takes months to grow crops. If price rises, farmers can't just "make more wheat" tomorrow. (Inelastic).
* **Manufacturing:** Factories can usually speed up assembly lines quickly. (Elastic).
