# **1. Definition of Supply**
> The quantity of a good or service that producers are **willing and able** to offer for sale at a given price in a given time period.

* **Profit Motive:** Producers exist to make profit.
* **Willing:** If price is high, they want to sell more.
* **Able:** They have the resources to produce it.

---

# **2. The Law of Supply**
There is a **direct (positive) relationship** between price and quantity supplied.
* As Price **Rises** $\uparrow$, Quantity Supplied **Rises** $\uparrow$.
* As Price **Falls** $\downarrow$, Quantity Supplied **Falls** $\downarrow$.

## **The Supply Curve Diagram**
* **Slope:** Upward sloping from left to right (like climbing a hill).
* **Reason:** Higher prices encourage firms to produce more because the potential for **profit** is higher. It also covers the higher costs of increasing output.

# **3. Movements Along the Curve (Price Changes)**
Just like with Demand, if the **Price of the good itself** changes, you move *along* the curve.

| Term | Cause | Effect on Graph |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Extension** of Supply | Price **Rises** | Movement **up** the curve (Quantity rises). |
| **Contraction** of Supply | Price **Falls** | Movement **down** the curve (Quantity falls). |

> **Mnemonic:** "Price moves *you* along the line."

# **4. Shifts of the Curve (Non-Price Factors)**
If anything *other* than the selling price changes (e.g., the cost to make the product), the entire curve moves.

* **Increase in Supply:** Shift **Right** (Firms offer *more* at the same price).
* **Decrease in Supply:** Shift **Left** (Firms offer *less* at the same price).



## **What causes a Shift? (Conditions of Supply)**
Think about what makes it easier, cheaper, or harder to produce.

### **A. Costs of Production**
This is the most common factor.
* **Wages, Raw Materials, Rent, Energy.**
* **If Costs Rise:** It becomes less profitable to produce. Supply shifts **Left**.
* **If Costs Fall:** It becomes cheaper to produce. Supply shifts **Right**.

### **B. Technology**
* New machinery or software increases **Productivity**.
* Firms can produce more with the same resources.
* Effect: Supply shifts **Right**.

### **C. Government Intervention (Taxes & Subsidies)**
1.  **Indirect Taxes (e.g., VAT, Excise Duty):**
    * This is an extra cost for the firm.
    * Increases costs $\rightarrow$ Supply shifts **Left**.
2.  **Subsidies:**
    * A payment from the government to producers to encourage production.
    * Lowers costs $\rightarrow$ Supply shifts **Right**.

### **D. Weather / Natural Factors**
* Crucial for **Agricultural** goods (farming).
* **Good weather:** Bumper harvest $\rightarrow$ Supply shifts **Right**.
* **Bad weather/Flood:** Destroyed crops $\rightarrow$ Supply shifts **Left**.

## **Summary Table: Supply Factors**

| Scenario | Impact on Cost/Output | Direction of Shift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New robot technology installed** | Costs $\downarrow$ / Efficiency $\uparrow$ | **Right** (Increase) |
| **Government increases tax on petrol** | Costs $\uparrow$ | **Left** (Decrease) |
| **Price of raw materials (e.g., wood) rises** | Costs $\uparrow$ | **Left** (Decrease) |
| **Government gives grant (subsidy) to farmers** | Costs $\downarrow$ | **Right** (Increase) |

# **5. Interaction of Supply and Demand (Chapter 5 Preview)**
Since we now have both curves:
* **Market Equilibrium:** Where Supply meets Demand ($S = D$).
* **Shortage:** Prices are too low, so $D > S$.
* **Surplus:** Prices are too high, so $S > D$.
