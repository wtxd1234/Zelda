# **1. Definition of Demand**
In Economics, "Demand" is not just wanting something. It is defined as:
> The quantity of a good or service that consumers are **willing and able** to buy at a given price in a given time period.

* **Willing:** You desire the product.
* **Able:** You have the money to pay for it.
* **Effective Demand:** When both conditions are met.

---

# **2. The Law of Demand**
There is an **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.
* As Price **Rises** $\uparrow$, Quantity Demanded **Falls** $\downarrow$.
* As Price **Falls** $\downarrow$, Quantity Demanded **Rises** $\uparrow$.

## **The Demand Curve Diagram**
* **Y-Axis:** Price (P)
* **X-Axis:** Quantity (Q)
* **Slope:** Downward sloping from left to right.

> **Reason for the slope:**
> 1.  **Income Effect:** If price falls, your money goes further, so you can afford more.
> 2.  **Substitution Effect:** If price falls, the good becomes cheaper compared to rivals, so you switch to it.

# **3. Movements Along the Curve (Price Changes)**
If the **Price of the good itself** changes, you do **not** draw a new curve. You move *along* the existing line.

| Term | Cause | Effect on Graph |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Extension** of Demand | Price **Falls** | Movement **down** the curve (Quantity rises). |
| **Contraction** of Demand | Price **Rises** | Movement **up** the curve (Quantity falls). |



---

# **4. Shifts of the Curve (Non-Price Factors)**
If **anything other than price** changes, the entire curve moves. This is called a **Shift**.

* **Increase in Demand:** Curve shifts **Right** (Consumers want *more* at the same price).
* **Decrease in Demand:** Curve shifts **Left** (Consumers want *less* at the same price).



## **What causes a Shift? (Conditions of Demand)**
You must memorize these factors (often remembered with acronyms like **PASIFIC**).

### **A. Income**
How income affects demand depends on the *type* of good:
1.  **Normal Goods:** As Income $\uparrow$, Demand $\uparrow$ (Shift Right).
    * *Examples:* New cars, holidays, restaurant meals.
2.  **Inferior Goods:** As Income $\uparrow$, Demand $\downarrow$ (Shift Left).
    * *Examples:* Instant noodles, bus travel, store-brand bread. (People switch to better alternatives).

### **B. Price of Related Goods**
1.  **Substitutes:** Goods that replace each other (e.g., Coke and Pepsi).
    * If Price of Coke $\uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ Demand for Pepsi $\uparrow$ (Shift Right).
    * *Positive relationship.*
2.  **Complements:** Goods used together (e.g., Printers and Ink).
    * If Price of Printers $\uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ Demand for Ink $\downarrow$ (Shift Left).
    * *Inverse relationship.*

### **C. Tastes and Preferences**
* Trends, fashion, and health scares affect demand.
* *Example:* A report says "Avocados make you live longer" $\rightarrow$ Demand for avocados shifts **Right**.

### **D. Advertising**
* Successful advertising campaigns increase loyalty and desire $\rightarrow$ Shift **Right**.

### **E. Population**
* An increase in population (more people) means more consumers $\rightarrow$ Shift **Right**.
* Changes in age structure also matter (e.g., aging population $\rightarrow$ higher demand for healthcare).

## **Summary Table: Shift vs. Movement**

| Scenario | Type of Change | Visual |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price of the product changes** | Movement (Extension/Contraction) | Slide along the line. |
| **Income changes** | Shift | Whole line moves Left/Right. |
| **Competitor's price changes** | Shift | Whole line moves Left/Right. |
| **Advertising increases** | Shift | Whole line moves Left/Right. |

> **Exam Tip:** In a "Explain the diagram" question, always start by checking axes. If the variable on the Y-axis (Price) changed, it's a movement. If a variable *not* on the axes changed, it's a shift.
