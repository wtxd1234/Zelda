# **1. The Three Sectors of the Economy**
All production in an economy is classified into three sectors.

| Sector | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Extraction of raw materials from the earth/nature. | Agriculture, fishing, mining, oil extraction, forestry. |
| **Secondary** | Manufacturing and processing raw materials into finished goods. | Car manufacturing, construction, food processing, textile factories. |
| **Tertiary** | The provision of services to consumers and other businesses. | Banking, education, healthcare, retail, tourism, transport. |

> **Trend to Watch:** As countries develop (like the UK or Singapore), they typically move from Primary $\rightarrow$ Secondary $\rightarrow$ Tertiary. This is called **De-industrialisation** (the decline of the manufacturing sector).

# **2. Production vs. Productivity**
These two sound similar but have very different meanings in the exam.

* **Production:** The **total output** of goods and services produced by a firm or economy in a period of time.
    * *Example:* A factory makes 1,000 cars.
* **Productivity:** A measure of **efficiency**. It is the output per unit of input (usually per worker).
    * *Formula:* $\text{Productivity} = \frac{\text{Total Output}}{\text{Number of Workers}}$
    * *Example:* If 10 workers make 1,000 cars, productivity is 100 cars per worker.

# **3. Specialisation & Division of Labour**

## **Definitions**
* **Specialisation:** When individuals, firms, regions, or countries concentrate on producing specific goods or services that they are best at.
* **Division of Labour:** Breaking down the production process into smaller, separate tasks, with each worker allocated to a specific task. (Famous example: Adam Smith’s Pin Factory).

## **Pros and Cons of Division of Labour (for the Firm)**

| Advantages (Why do it?) | Disadvantages (What goes wrong?) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Efficiency:** Workers become highly skilled at their one task. | **Boredom:** Repetitive tasks lead to low motivation and high worker turnover. |
| **Time Saving:** Less time wasted moving between tools or stations. | **Interdependence:** If one machine breaks or one specialized worker is absent, the whole production line stops. |
| **Machinery:** Allows the use of specialized machinery (Capital). | **Structural Unemployment:** If demand for that specific product falls, specialized workers may not have skills for other jobs. |
| **Lower Costs:** Higher productivity leads to lower cost per unit. | |

# **4. Money**
Specialisation creates a problem: if I only make shoes, how do I get bread?
Without money, we would need to use **Barter** (swapping goods). Barter requires a **Double Coincidence of Wants** (I must have what you want, AND you must have what I want). Money solves this.

## **The 4 Functions of Money**
1.  **Medium of Exchange:** It allows goods and services to be traded without barter.
2.  **Unit of Account:** It measures the value of goods (e.g., a price tag showing £10).
3.  **Store of Value:** It can be saved and spent later (provided inflation doesn't destroy it).
4.  **Standard of Deferred Payment:** It allows people to borrow now and pay back later.

# **5. Economic Systems**
Every country must answer three questions to solve the Economic Problem:
1.  **What** to produce?
2.  **How** to produce?
3.  **For whom** to produce?

There are three ways to answer these:

## **A. Free Market Economy (Capitalism)**
* **Who decides?** Private individuals and firms.
* **Mechanism:** The **Price Mechanism** (Supply and Demand).
* **Role of Govt:** Very limited (only protects property rights/law).
* **Advantages:** Efficiency, innovation, consumer choice.
* **Disadvantages:** Inequality (rich vs poor), monopolies, missing public goods (no street lights).

## **B. Planned / Command Economy**
* **Who decides?** The Government (State).
* **Mechanism:** State planning / Quotas.
* **Role of Govt:** Owns all resources (Factors of Production).
* **Advantages:** Low unemployment, less inequality, production of essential goods.
* **Disadvantages:** Inefficient (no profit motive), shortages/surpluses, lack of choice.

## **C. Mixed Economy**
* **Definition:** An economy where goods and services are provided by **both** the private sector and the public (government) sector.
* **Reality:** Almost every country (UK, USA, Malaysia) is a Mixed Economy.
    * *Private Sector:* Provides consumer goods (phones, clothes).
    * *Public Sector:* Provides public goods and merit goods (defense, education, healthcare).

## **Quick Summary for Chapter 2**
* **Sectors:** Primary (Raw), Secondary (Make), Tertiary (Service).
* **Productivity:** Efficiency (Output per worker).
* **Division of Labour:** Splitting tasks $\rightarrow$ Higher efficiency but boredom.
* **Functions of Money:** Exchange, Account, Store, Deferred Payment.
* **Mixed Economy:** Private + Public sectors working together.
