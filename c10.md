This chapter marks the start of **Macroeconomics**.
* **Microeconomics (Ch 1–9):** Looking at individual trees (one firm, one consumer, one market).
* **Macroeconomics (Ch 10+):** Looking at the whole forest (the entire country's economy).

# **1. The Main Government Objectives**
Before diving into growth, you need to know the top goals every government aims for:
1.  **Economic Growth** (Increasing output/income).
2.  **Low Inflation** (Stable prices).
3.  **Low Unemployment** (Jobs for everyone).
4.  **Balance of Payments Stability** (Exports vs. Imports).
5.  **Income Equality** (Fair gap between rich and poor).
6.  **Environmental Protection**.

*Chapter 10 focuses on Objective #1.*

# **2. What is Economic Growth?**
> **Definition:** An increase in the real value of goods and services produced by an economy over time.

It essentially means the country is getting richer and producing more stuff.

## **Measuring Growth: GDP**
* **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a year.
* **GDP per Capita:** The average income per person.
    $$GDP \text{ per Capita} = \frac{\text{Total GDP}}{\text{Population}}$$
    * *Why use per Capita?* It gives a better idea of the **Standard of Living**. If GDP grows by 2%, but the population grows by 5%, the average person is actually poorer.

# **3. Real vs. Nominal GDP**
This is a crucial distinction for the exam.

* **Nominal GDP:** The value of GDP at **current market prices** (without adjusting for inflation).
    * *Example:* If prices double but we produce the exact same amount of goods, Nominal GDP doubles. It looks like growth, but it's fake.
* **Real GDP:** The value of GDP adjusted for **inflation**.
    * It measures the actual **volume** of goods produced.
    * *Formula idea:* Real GDP = Nominal GDP - Inflation.

> **Exam Tip:** Always talk about **Real GDP** when discussing changes in living standards.

# **4. The Economic Cycle (The Business Cycle)**
Economies do not grow in a straight line. They go up and down in a regular pattern known as the Economic Cycle.

## **The 4 Stages:**
1.  **Boom:**
    * High GDP growth.
    * Low unemployment (everyone has jobs).
    * High confidence (firms invest, consumers spend).
    * **Risk:** High Inflation (prices rise because demand is too high).
2.  **Recession (Downturn):**
    * GDP growth slows down or becomes negative (Real GDP falls for 2 consecutive quarters).
    * Unemployment starts to rise.
    * Confidence falls.
3.  **Slump (Depression):**
    * The bottom of the cycle.
    * High unemployment.
    * Many firms go bankrupt.
    * Low inflation (or deflation).
4.  **Recovery:**
    * GDP starts to rise again.
    * Jobs are created.
    * Confidence returns.

# **5. The Benefits and Costs of Growth**

Is growth always good? Usually, yes, but it has side effects.

| **Benefits of Growth** | **Costs of Growth** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Higher Standard of Living:** People have higher incomes and can buy more wants/needs. | **Environmental Damage:** More factories = more pollution, deforestation, and waste (Negative Externalities). |
| **Lower Unemployment:** Firms produce more, so they need to hire more workers. | **Inflation Risk:** If demand grows too fast (Boom), prices skyrocket, making cost of living high. |
| **Fiscal Dividend:** With higher incomes, people pay more tax. The Govt gets more money to spend on schools/hospitals without raising tax rates. | **Inequality:** Growth often benefits the rich (business owners) more than the poor, widening the gap. |
| **Confidence:** Investment rises, creating a positive cycle. | **Resource Depletion:** We might use up all our oil/gas, leaving none for future generations (Unsustainable). |

# **6. Limitations of GDP as a Measure**
Does a high GDP mean everyone is happy? Not necessarily.
* **The Hidden Economy:** GDP doesn't count unpaid work (housework, caring for elderly) or illegal/cash-in-hand work.
* **Inequality:** A country could have high GDP because one person is a trillionaire, while everyone else is starving. GDP averages hide this.
* **Quality of Life:** GDP counts money, not happiness, health, crime rates, or working hours.
    * *Example:* If there is a massive oil spill, GDP might actually **go up** because money is spent cleaning it up. That doesn't mean the oil spill was "good."

## **Summary for Chapter 10**
* **Macro Objectives:** Growth, Inflation, Unemployment, Trade.
* **GDP:** Total output.
* **Real GDP:** Adjusted for inflation (Volume).
* **Cycle:** Boom $\rightarrow$ Recession $\rightarrow$ Slump $\rightarrow$ Recovery.
* **Evaluation:** Growth is good for income/jobs, but bad for the environment/inflation.
