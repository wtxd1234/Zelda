# **1. Definition of PED**
> **Price Elasticity of Demand** measures the **responsiveness** of quantity demanded to a change in price.

* **High Responsiveness (Elastic):** You buy *a lot less* when price rises.
* **Low Responsiveness (Inelastic):** You buy *almost the same amount* even if price rises.

# **2. The Formula**
You **must** memorize this formula. It is often a 2-mark calculation question.

## **The Negative Sign**
* Because Price and Demand move in opposite directions (Law of Demand), the mathematical answer is almost always **negative** (e.g., $-2.0$).
* **Exam Rule:** In IGCSE Economics, we usually **ignore the minus sign** and look at the absolute number to decide if it is elastic or inelastic.

# **3. Interpreting the Value**

| Value | Term | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** (e.g., 2.5) | **Price Elastic** | Demand changes by a **larger** percentage than price. Consumers are very sensitive. | Luxury cars, branded chocolate. |
| **Less than 1** (e.g., 0.4) | **Price Inelastic** | Demand changes by a **smaller** percentage than price. Consumers don't care much about the price change. | Petrol, tap water, cigarettes. |
| **Exactly 1** | **Unit Elastic** | The % change in demand is **exactly equal** to the % change in price. | (Rare in real life). |

# **4. The Diagrams (Steep vs. Flat)**
The shape of the demand curve tells you the elasticity.

1.  **Inelastic Demand:** The curve is **Steep** (looks like the letter **I** for Inelastic).
    * A big price jump leads to only a tiny drop in quantity.
2.  **Elastic Demand:** The curve is **Flat**.
    * A tiny price jump leads to a huge drop in quantity.

# **5. Determinants of PED (What makes a good Elastic?)**
Remember the acronym **SPLT** (Substitutes, Percentage of Income, Luxury/Necessity, Time).

| Factor | Elastic Demand (Responsive) | Inelastic Demand (Unresponsive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Substitutes** | **Many Substitutes:** If Coke gets expensive, you switch to Pepsi easily. | **Few Substitutes:** If petrol gets expensive, you still need it to drive. |
| **Percentage of Income** | **High %:** Buying a car takes a lot of your money, so you check prices carefully. | **Low %:** Buying a box of matches is cheap; you don't care if price rises 10%. |
| **Luxury vs. Necessity** | **Luxury:** You don't *need* a diamond ring, so you stop buying if price rises. | **Necessity:** You *need* bread/rice, so you keep buying. |
| **Time Period** | **Long Run:** You have time to find alternatives (e.g., buy an electric car). | **Short Run:** You need the product *now* (e.g., buying petrol today). |

# **6. PED and Total Revenue**
This is the most practical part for business owners.
**Total Revenue (TR) = Price $\times$ Quantity**.

Firms use PED to decide whether to **raise** or **lower** prices to make more money.

## **Scenario A: Inelastic Demand (< 1)**
* **Customers are addicted/need the product.**
* **Strategy:** **Raise the Price.**
* **Why?** You lose very few customers, but every remaining customer pays more. TR Increases.

## **Scenario B: Elastic Demand (> 1)**
* **Customers are sensitive/have options.**
* **Strategy:** **Lower the Price.**
* **Why?** You gain *lots* of new customers, which outweighs the lower price per unit. TR Increases.

> **Summary Rule:**
> * **Elastic:** Price and Revenue move in **Opposite** directions (Price $\downarrow$ Revenue $\uparrow$).
> * **Inelastic:** Price and Revenue move in the **Same** direction (Price $\uparrow$ Revenue $\uparrow$).
