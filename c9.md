# **1. Purpose of Intervention**
The government intervenes to:
1.  Reduce the consumption of **Demerit Goods** (e.g., cigarettes).
2.  Increase the consumption of **Merit Goods** (e.g., healthcare).
3.  Provide **Public Goods** (e.g., street lights).
4.  Reduce **Externalities** (pollution).

---

# **2. Method A: Indirect Taxes**
A tax on expenditure (goods and services). The goal is to **increase the cost of production**, shifting supply to the left, raising the price, and discouraging consumption.

* **Target:** Demerit goods (Negative Externalities).
* **The Mechanism:**
    1.  Government puts a tax on plastic bags.
    2.  Firm's costs rise.
    3.  Supply curve shifts **Left**.
    4.  Price rises $\rightarrow$ Quantity Demanded falls.

## **Evaluation (Pros & Cons)**
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Corrects Market Failure:** Reduces consumption of harmful goods. | **Inelastic Demand:** If consumers are addicted (e.g., cigarettes), they will pay the higher price anyway. Quantity won't drop much. |
| **Government Revenue:** Raises money that can be spent on schools/hospitals. | **Regressive:** High taxes on essential goods hurt the poor more than the rich (takes a higher % of their income). |
| | **Black Markets:** High taxes encourage smuggling/illegal sales. |

# **3. Method B: Subsidies**
A payment given to producers to lower their costs and encourage production.

* **Target:** Merit goods (Positive Externalities).
* **The Mechanism:**
    1.  Government gives a subsidy to solar panel makers.
    2.  Firm's costs fall.
    3.  Supply curve shifts **Right**.
    4.  Price falls $\rightarrow$ Quantity Demanded rises.



## **Evaluation (Pros & Cons)**
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Encourages Merit Goods:** Makes essential goods (like vaccines or electric cars) affordable for everyone. | **Opportunity Cost:** Subsidies cost tax money. That money could have been used elsewhere. |
| **Boosts Industry:** Protects jobs and helps new industries grow. | **Inefficiency:** If firms rely on subsidies, they may become lazy and stop trying to cut costs. |

# **4. Method C: Regulation (Laws & Rules)**
Using the legal system to control behavior.

* **Examples:**
    * Banning smoking in public places.
    * Setting a minimum age for alcohol (18+).
    * Compulsory education until age 16.
    * Banning single-use plastics.

## **Evaluation (Pros & Cons)**
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear & Strong:** There is no confusion—it is simply illegal. | **Policing Costs:** It costs money to hire police/inspectors to enforce the rules. |
| **Works for Inelastic Goods:** Unlike taxes, a ban stops even addicted consumers (mostly). | **Black Markets:** Banning a popular product often creates illegal underground markets. |

---

# **5. Method D: State Provision**
The government decides that the private sector is doing a bad job, so it provides the good or service itself, funded by taxes.

* **Target:** Public Goods and Merit Goods.
* **Examples:** The NHS (healthcare), State Schools, Police, Army.

## **Evaluation (Pros & Cons)**
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fairness (Equity):** Everyone gets access, regardless of income. | **Cost:** Very expensive for the government (high taxes needed). |
| **Fixes Missing Markets:** Ensures public goods (street lights) are actually built. | **Inefficiency:** Government monopolies lack competition, so they might be slow or wasteful compared to private firms. |

## **Summary Table: Choosing the Right Tool**

| Problem | Best Tool | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cigarettes (Demerit)** | **Indirect Tax** | Raises price + Raises revenue. |
| **Pollution (Externality)** | **Regulation (Fines)** | Hard to tax air; easier to fine polluters. |
| **Education (Merit)** | **State Provision** | Too expensive for poor if private; crucial for society. |
| **Electric Cars (Merit)** | **Subsidy** | Makes new tech competitive against petrol cars. |
